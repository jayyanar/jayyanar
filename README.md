I'm **[Ayyanar Jeyakrishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayyanar/)** ; aka **AJ**. 

With over 20 years of dedicated IT expertise, I bring a wealth of experience coupled with strong analytical and technical leadership skills to the table.

As a strategic thinker, my focus is always on the long-term goals, and I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with diverse stakeholders, including CXOs, technology leaders, and executive teams.

My professional journey has been characterized by hands-on, in-depth involvement in cutting-edge fields such as DevOps, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. This comprehensive knowledge allows me to adapt and innovate in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond my day-to-day responsibilities, I'm passionate about knowledge sharing. I've had the privilege of serving as a speaker, delivering tech talks and workshops on a wide range of topics at conferences and meet-ups.
